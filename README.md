# SCRAPS Algorithm
- Secure Cryptographic Retention and Progressive Storage

## Overview

This algorithm aim is to securely storing and managing confidential data. the core of this algorithm lies in the periodically "trashing"  ( !scraping was already in use! ) data  by hashing and organizing it in multi-tier form, making it highly resistant to unauthorized access and reverse-engineering.

## Features

- **Secure Data Management**: Data is hashed and organized in tiers, making it difficult for unauthorized access and data recovery extremely challenging.
- **Periodic Trashing**: Data is periodically moved to deeper tiers, resemblling the effect of real life trash or scraps continue to pile up, thus providing more security.
- **Resource-Intensive Retrieval**: Retrieving data requires significantly more computational resources and enhancing security against potential attacks.
